<h2>What is a checkpoint in DBMS? & When does checkpoint occur in DBMS?</h2>
<anotepad><pre>The Checkpoint is a type of mechanism where all the previous logs are removed from the system and permanently stored in the storage disk.
A checkpoint is like a snapshot of the DBMS state. Using checkpoints, the DBMS can reduce the amount of work to be done during a restart in the event of subsequent crashes. Checkpoints are used for the recovery of the database after the system crash. Checkpoints are used in the log-based recovery system. When due to a system crash we need to restart the system then at that point we use checkpoints. So that, we don't have to perform the transactions from the very starting.</pre></anotepad>
